# **We Built ThriveBridge.ca — A Digital Bridge to Help Newcomers Thrive in Canada**

---

## 🎓 **Capstone Project Completion**

After months of research, design, engineering, and collaboration, we’re proud to share our capstone project: **ThriveBridge.ca**, a digital platform built to empower global citizens navigating the journey of immigration, financial readiness, and career development in Canada.

This project was more than a website — it was our attempt to solve a deeply human problem:

> **“Why is it so hard for newcomers to find clear, trustworthy guidance when starting a new life in Canada?”**

We wanted to change that.
